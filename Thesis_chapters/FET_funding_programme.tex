\section{The Horizon 2020 programme} \label{The_Horizon_2020_programme}
Horizon 2020 is the biggest Research and Innovation funding programme financed by the European Union to date. It aims at ensuring a smart and sustainable societal and economic growth by investing on and applying scientific research. The programme has a total budget of nearly 80 billions euro over a seven-year period (from 2014 to 2020).

Horizon 2020 is Europe's eighth Research and Innovation programme in chronological order. Previous programmes were each four years long, with the first launched in 1984. The increasing budget allocated for the Research and Innovation programmes is shown in figure \ref{FP_funds}.

Any natural or legal persons such as universities, research organisation, companies etc. can apply for funding from Horizon 2020. Applications must fit into one of the following categories: 

\begin{itemize}
 \item \textbf{Excellent Science:} the goal of this initiative is to support and increase the excellence of European scientific research on a global level in a variety of fields.
 \item \textbf{Industrial Leadership:} this class of projects targets the development of the technological innovations of tomorrow's market and the growth of European small and medium enterprises.
 \item \textbf{Societal Challenges:} this group focuses on priorities of the European society such as health, education, energy supply and food by combining knowledge and methods from different scientific fields and humanities.  
 \item \textbf{European Institute for Innovation and Technology (EIT):} the EIT is an independent European body supporting European growth by promoting synergies among three key societal players: education, research and business. 
 \item \textbf{Euratom:} this pillar focuses on nuclear research and safety with to the goal to contribute to the decarbonisation of the energy supply.
\end{itemize}

The budget breakdown of the Horizon 2020 into the aforementioned lines of action is shown in figure \ref{H2020_budget_breakdown}

\section{The FET programme} 
As mentioned in section \ref{The_Horizon_2020_programme}, one of the pillars of Horizon 2020 is the Excellent Science programme. This initiative supports researchers and institutions developing new science and cutting-edge technology. The goal is to keep European research at the forefront of scientific innovation and discover applications to improve the citizens' life and ensure economical growth.  

\begin{table}[t]

  \begin{tabular}{cc}
   \hline

   ERC & 13095 \\
   FET & 2696 \\
   MSCA & 6162 \\
   RI & 2488 \\

ERC stands for European Research Council; FET for Future and Emerging Technologies; MSCA for Marie Sk\l{}odowska-Curie Actions; RI for Research infrastructure. The estimated final amounts are expressed in million euros.}
\label{FET_budget_breakdown} 
\end{table}

Excellent Science is based on the four following pillars: 

\begin{itemize}
 \item \textbf{European Research Council (ERC):} The ERC assigns funding in every field of research to single scientists working in only one host institution and with the requirement of scientific excellence.  
 \item \textbf{Future and Emerging Technologies (FET):} the FET programme finances collaborative research exploring visionary and radically new investigation lines. 
 \item \textbf{Marie Sk\l{}odowska-Curie Actions:} this initiative provides grants for researchers at any stage of their career with the goal to encourage mobility between countries and fields of expertise. 
 \item \textbf{Research infrastructure:} this pillar promotes the creation of networks of transnational research infrastructures as well as the training of qualified staff. 
\end{itemize}

The estimated final budget breakdown of Excellent Science is reported in table \ref{FET_budget_breakdown}.

The present thesis focuses on the communication activity of the 151 Horizon 2020 projects funded within the FET scheme to date. The complete list of these projects is available in Appendix ... . Their distribution per country as of June 2016 is shown in figure \ref{Country_participation_in_H2020_FET_projects}

The FET funding scheme comprises three calls for applications: FET Open, FET Proactive and FET Flagship.

\subsubsection{FET Open}
The FET Open call is not related to a specific investigation theme. However, submitted research proposals must satisfy the following ``gatekeepers": scientific and technological breakthrough; foundational; novelty; high-risk; long-term vision; interdisciplinary. FET Open promotes the so-called Coordination and Support Actions (CSA) as well. These actions aim at identifying and fulfil the optimal conditions for FET-related collaborative. One CSA type of action is FET Innovation Launchpad, which investigates and explores possible economical and societal applications of results from FET projects.

\subsubsection{FET Proactive}
The FET Proactive call targets the creation of scientific synergies of researchers from 

supports the aims at bringing 

to nurture investigation networks of scientists from interdisciplinary fields by bringing scientists from disparate fields together  of scientists from disparate interdisciplenary fields working together on given topics. The topics are not ready for the market. Currently, FET Proactive comprises three calls related to the topic "Boosting emerging technologies" and three under the topic "High Performance Computing". Given its relevance for the scope of this thesi, the "High Performance Computing" FET PRoactive call is more extensively outlined in section..... Besides this, FET Proactive invests resources also on identifying investigation roadmaps for the considered areas, design and distribute material for educational purposes and disseminate FET results among stakeholders.  

\subsubsection{FET Flagships}
FET Flagships are the main efforts of European research. They are large-scale, decade-long projects each with available budget totalling one billion Euros. The ultimate goals are to shed light on key scientific themes and apply scientific achievements to European society. To date, three FET Flagships have been approved in the Horizon 2020 programme: 

\begin{itemize}
 \item the Human Brain Project, which targets significant step forwards in neuroscience.
 \item Graphene, which exploring Graphene's properties and possible applications.
 \item Quantum technologies, aiming at development of groundbreaking technologies based on the laws of quantum physics.
\end{itemize}
The Human Brain Project and Graphene Flagship started in April 2016. The Quantum technologies Flagship will start running in 2018. Given the importance for the scope of this thesis, the Quantum technologies flaghisp is described in more detail in section ...
