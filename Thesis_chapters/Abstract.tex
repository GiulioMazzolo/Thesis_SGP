\chapter*{Abstract}
This thesis focuses on the use of social media for communication and dissemination purposes made by EU-funded research projects in Future and Emerging Technologies (FET). 

The work analyses and compares the activity on the Twitter platform of FET projects in high performing computing (HPC) and quantum technologies (QT) as well. The two classes of initiatives show a very different approach. The vast majority of HPC projects has considered Twitter for communication campaigns, whereas no QT group has created a profile. The result is not strongly influenced by the budget available to the projects.
